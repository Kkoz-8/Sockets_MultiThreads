lame cmd chat box

Anyways, i watched some vids online, youtube,
corey schafer, tech with tim, and sentdex.
i also used other resources, like text books, stack overflow and other websites.

>_> used lots of stuff. 

Managed to understand why the code works, and it is a good feeling to understand how and why it works the way it does.

anyways, run server code, change port etc as needed.
then edit port etc in client code to match,
and well...now you can send and receive messages from other clients connected to server.

..thats it...took me like a whole bloody week to figure this out. sigh.
